# Drummer Toolkit 🥁

**The ultimate all-in-one toolkit for drummers.** A professional, evolving suite of tools designed to master rhythm and elevate every aspect of your practice on iOS.

**Drummer Toolkit** is built entirely with **SwiftUI** and **AVFoundation**, offering sample-accurate timing and a beautiful, modern interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Standard Metronome**: High-precision timing with customizable time signatures, subdivisions, and accents.
*   **Polyrhythms**: Practice complex cross-rhythms (e.g., 3:4, 5:7) with independent volume controls for each pulse.
*   **Accelerando**: Automatically increase or decrease tempo over time to build speed and control.
*   **BeatFlux**: Improve your internal clock by randomly muting beats or measures (gap click training).
*   **Ghost Metronome**: A unique mode where the click drops out silently to test your time-keeping stability.
*   **Gap Click**: Programmable silence intervals (e.g., Play 3 bars, Mute 1 bar).

## 🛠 Technical Stack

*   **UI**: 100% SwiftUI with custom animations and responsive design.
*   **Audio**: Low-latency engine using `AVAudioEngine` for sample-accurate timing.
*   **Architecture**: MVVM with Combine for state management.
*   **Localization**: Fully localized in English, German (`de`), Spanish (`es`), French (`fr`), Portuguese (`pt-BR`), Japanese (`ja`), and Chinese (`zh-Hans`).

## 💎 Pro Features

*   **Sound Packs**: Customizable metronome sounds (Woodblock, Sticks, Digital, etc.).
*   **Themes**: Beautiful visual themes (Cyan, Sunset, Neon, Forest, etc.).
*   **Background Audio**: Continues playing when the screen is locked or app is in background.

## 📱 Requirements

*   iOS 16.0+
*   Xcode 15.0+ (for building)
